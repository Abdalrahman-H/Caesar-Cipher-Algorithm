## Introduction
Caesar Cipher is a symmetric encryption algorithm that transforms plain text into cipher text using a secret key. It is a substitution cipher that replaces each letter in the plain text with another letter based on a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

The Caesar Cipher algorithm offers a simple yet effective way to protect your data from unauthorized access. By using this repository, you will gain a better understanding of how the cipher works and how to implement it in your projects.

## Installation
To use Caesar Cipher in your project, you can simply clone this repository to your local machine using the following command: 

==> git clone https://github.com/Abdalrahman-H/Caesar-Cipher-Algorithm.git

## Usage
Once you have cloned the repository, you can start using the Casper Cipher encryption and decryption functions in your code.
